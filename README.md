This is a demo page created for a workshop held at the University of Sheffield to showcase the work developed at UCD teach educators how to place 3D models into their teaching materials.
This uses the <model-viewer> web component to make the process as easy as possible. JavaScript is used to manipulate the animaiton playback speed. The 3D model presented is sourced from [NASA](https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/ingenuity_thumb) and the blender is slightly modifed before being exported as glb.
Modifications include applying object transformations and adding rotation to the rotor blades. The material for the solar panel was adjusted by replacing the shader used with the principled shader so it works correctly in <model-viewer>.
